# Battle of the Knights

Created Friday June 23, 2023

### How to play:

Attack deals random damage to opponent. Defend prevents the attack. Rest gains health points.

Choose 'a', 'd', or 'r':
* 'a' => ATTACK
* 'd' => DEFEND
* 'r' => REST

#### Constraints:
* Game does not allow greater than 100 health points for a player.
* Zero or less health points results in death within the game.

#### Possibilities
* A -> <- A
* D -- -- D
* R +   + R
* A -- -- D
* D -- -- A
* A ->  + R
* R +  <- A
* R +  -- D
* D --  + R

#### LATER IDEAS

* no more than two of the same move in a row??
* two player mode
* additional choices
* classes / archetypes for player to choose from??
* CPU opponent strategies and difficulties...
